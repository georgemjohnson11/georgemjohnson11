## üíº Experience

One of the key projects that best demonstrates my expertise in building infrastructure and scalable systems is the migration from monolithic applications to a microservices architecture at Foresight Diagnostics. I led a team in transitioning two Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects, which previously relied on large, monolithic applications, into a modular microservices-based architecture. This transition significantly improved system scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility. To streamline this process, I implemented Terraform for infrastructure as code, reducing provisioning time by 40%. A key challenge in this migration was ensuring smooth inter-service communication and minimizing downtime during deployment. By carefully designing APIs and optimizing service interactions, I was able to enhance system reliability and responsiveness while maintaining regulatory compliance for medical software.

Another project that highlights my ability to design and optimize large-scale infrastructure was the platform migration at Invitae, where I led the transition of over 50 bare-metal AWS servers to a Kubernetes-managed cluster. This shift dramatically improved scalability, automation, and system resilience. In addition to the migration, I established Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), and Service Level Objectives (SLOs), leading to a 17% increase in system reliability. One of the main challenges in this project was migrating legacy applications without disrupting critical business operations. I tackled this by implementing a phased deployment strategy and integrating robust monitoring solutions using Prometheus and Grafana to proactively detect and resolve potential issues. This project not only modernized the infrastructure but also laid the groundwork for more efficient and cost-effective cloud operations.
